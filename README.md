# Database-Final-Project
A final project for my Databases class. The purpose of this project was so that I could be familiar with SQL in a Java  GUI. At the time it was made, the Witch Queen DLC was added to Destiny 2. So, I created an SQL database detailing the stats for the weapons introduced in the DLC.
